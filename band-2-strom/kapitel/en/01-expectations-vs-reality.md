# Volume 2 – Chapter 1: Expectations vs. Reality

280 Ah.
That sounded like weekends without a power outlet.
Like freedom.
Like: power is no longer an issue.

That sentence had a half-life of about three days.

---

The battery is big.
Not compared to other boats, but big enough for a start.
Big enough that you nod when buying and think: This will be enough.

Then comes the first cloudy Wednesday.

---

Four days without sun.
Fridge running, because warm beer would be tragic.
A few hours of light, because you want to read.
The small constant consumer that supposedly only draws 2 amps. *Only.*

Battery empty.

Not dramatically empty.
Not "BMS shut down in protest" empty.
Just: empty enough that you stare at the display and calculate internally.

---

The datasheet says: 3,580 Wh.
That's theoretically six days.

Practically it's four.
On good days five.
On bad days three, and you're annoyed that you didn't turn off the TV earlier last night.

The difference between "should be enough" and "wasn't enough" is about as wide as the charging cable you now have to dig out.

---

You overestimate how long power lasts.
You underestimate how much small things draw.
You forget that a battery isn't a reserve, but a buffer between "everything still works" and "tomorrow it'll be dark".

That's not in the datasheet.
You learn that at the dock.
When the display shows 12.2 V and you think: Did I really need to watch three episodes yesterday?

---

The battery isn't the problem.
The expectation was the problem.

It's there.
It works.
It just doesn't last as long as you imagined in your head – while searching the internet for "living off-grid" with three solar calculator tabs open.

That's not disappointment.
That's the gentle reminder that advertising copy is more optimistic than November.

---

After a few weeks you stop calculating.
You just know when it's getting tight.
You feel it.
Sometimes you even smell it, when the neighbour fires up his generator.

And then you plug in shore power.
Or go for a cruise.
Or turn off the fridge at night and hope the beer is still cold enough.

No big deal.
Just different than expected.
But at least with beer.
