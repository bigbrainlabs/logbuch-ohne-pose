# Volume 2 – Chapter 3: Solar: Hope & Limits

260 Wp on the roof.
That should be enough.

In summer it is enough.
In summer you feel like an energy company.

---

On a good day in July:
1,200 Wh.
Sometimes more.

That covers consumption.
Tops up the battery.
You feel self-sufficient, wise, forward-thinking.
You briefly consider selling power to the neighbour.

---

On days like these, when the sun beats down on the solar panel and I sit on deck, I think of Kira.
She would have loved lying here, nose in the sun, happy.

Buster lies inside. Under the table. Soaking up the last cool spot.

They're both right.

---

Then October arrives.
And with it, the sobering reality.

---

Same panels.
Same charge controller.
Same consumption.

Yield: 500 Wh.
On bad days: significantly less.

The battery doesn't get full anymore.
It just gets less empty.
You stare at the display like a bank balance just before Christmas.

---

In December the sun sits low.
The panels lie flat on the roof, pretending to work.
Morning shadow from the superstructure.
Afternoon gets brief sun, then dark by half past three. Clocking off, dear photons.

Some days: 200 Wh.
Many days: less.
Some days: you wonder if the panels are even still there.

That's not a defect.
That's winter.
That's Germany.

---

Solar isn't a constant.
It's a promise that's only sometimes kept.
A bit like "I'll be right there" from the tradesman.

You learn not to wait for the sun.
You learn to count on it when it's there.
And to plan without it when it's gone.
You develop a relationship with weather forecasts you never had before.

---

The hope was: sun means independence.

The reality is: sun helps.
When it shines.
Where it reaches.
As long as it's bright enough.
And the neighbour's tree isn't in the way.

That's not disappointment.
That's physics.
With a touch of bad luck.

---

After a while you stop looking at the display in the morning.
You look outside.
Grey or blue.

That's forecast enough.
And if you're being honest: grey happens more often than expected.
