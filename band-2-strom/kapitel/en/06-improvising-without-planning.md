# Volume 2 – Chapter 6: Improvising Without Planning

When the plan isn't enough, you don't need a new plan.
You need adaptation.
And maybe coffee.

**Thought 1: Second Battery?**

280 Ah is full.
560 Ah would be fuller.
1,120 Ah would be even fuller.

Logical. Mathematically unassailable.

But:
More weight.
More cost.
More charging time.
More space you don't have.
And the nagging question: Do I need a bigger tank when the petrol station is right next door?

With daily cruising: not necessary.
With solar in summer: not necessary.
With both: definitely not.

The second battery remains an idea.
A good idea.
For later.
For the case that you actually anchor somewhere for three weeks without starting the engine. Which will never happen, but you never know.

**Thought 2: Electric Kettle**

230 V would be nice.
Electric kettle would be practical.
Coffee in three minutes would be luxury.

2,000 W for five minutes.
That's 170 Wh.

Sounds like nothing.

But at 12 V that's 180 A.
That's not "just making coffee".
That's "the battery briefly thinks it's in a starting sequence".

For one battery: borderline.
For two batteries: relaxed.
For gas: immediate.

Decision: Gas.
Not out of principle.
Out of pragmatism.
And because the camping stove is already there anyway.

Power for electronics.
Gas for heat.

Works.
Sometimes smells like propane, but works.

**Thought 3: Foldable Panel?**

In winter the roof doesn't bring enough.
A second, fixed panel: no space.
A third: even less space.
A fourth: now it's getting silly.

The idea: foldable.

200 Wp.
Out when needed.
Angled toward the sun.
Put away after use.
Like a camping table, only more expensive and with watts.

No permanent installation.
No project.
Just a tool you use when you need it.

Costs 150 to 200 euros.
Would often bring more than the roof in winter.
And you'd feel a bit like a space engineer. A little.

On the list.
For someday.
When the money doesn't have to go somewhere else.
As always.

**Solution 1: Less Consumption**

Fridge off at night.
Was the idea anyway.
Now routine.
And honestly: you don't need cold beer at night. Mostly.

Saves 100 Wh.
That's almost half a sunny day.
Or one more episode in the evening.

Light only where you need it.
TV only when you're actually watching. Not just because it's running.
Radio quiet instead of loud.
And the smartphone charges during the day, when the sun is working anyway.

Sounds like sacrifice.
But it's just: more conscious.
And after two weeks it's normal.
And after four weeks you forget it was ever different.

**Solution 2: Cruising as Charging Station**

Every day 2 to 8 hours underway.
Alternator runs.
DC-DC charger works.
Battery gets full.

That's more than consumption.
That's more than solar on average.
That's basically a mobile power plant, just without the chimney.

Cruising isn't extra.
Cruising is part of the system.
Cruising is the solution you do anyway, without thinking about it.

The perfect solution: the one you don't plan, but simply live.

**What Remains**

No major rebuild.
No expensive solutions.
No perfection.

Just small adjustments.
That work together.
Like a well-rehearsed team that's never met.

The system doesn't work because it's perfect.
It works because you understand how it ticks.
And because you've stopped searching for the perfect plan.

And that's enough.
Usually even with coffee.
