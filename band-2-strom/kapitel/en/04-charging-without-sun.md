# Volume 2 – Chapter 4: Charging Without Sun

The sun doesn't always shine.
Sometimes it doesn't shine for days.
Welcome to Germany.

But the battery still wants to be full.
And there are alternatives for that.

**Shore Power: The Easy Way**

In the home marina: cable out, plug in, done.
In the winter harbour anyway, because permanent mooring.

The charger has 20 amps.
That's about 250 watts.
That's about 6 hours from nearly empty to full.

Sounds like a lot of time.
It is.

But you don't have to stand there watching.
You plug in, go to sleep, wake up: battery full.
Like magic, only with an electricity bill.

---

The problem with shore power isn't shore power.
The problem is: you need a dock with an outlet.

In the home marina: no problem.
On the road: sometimes a problem.
In the middle of the canal: definitely a problem.

Shore power is the joker.
You play it when you can.
But you don't rely on it.

---

**The Alternator: The Cruising Way**

Engine on, alternator spins, power flows.
It's that simple.

How much power?
No idea.
Haven't dug that deep yet.

But: enough.
Enough that the battery is fuller after a few hours of cruising than before.
Even with all consumers on.
Even with fridge, chartplotter, and the radio that was forgotten again.

That's enough information.
For now.

---

The typical cruise: two to eight hours.
Sometimes more, sometimes less.
Depending on where you want to go and how much of a hurry you're in.

Spoiler: You're never in a hurry.
You're on a boat.

But no matter how long the trip – at the end the battery is better off than at the start.
Even though you used power along the way.

The alternator is like a colleague who quietly does their job.
You barely notice them.
But without them nothing would work.

---

**Cruising specifically to charge?**

Never done it.
Never needed to.

The combination of solar and cruising is enough.
In summer anyway.
In winter mostly.
And when it gets tight: shore power in the home marina.

You don't cruise to charge.
You charge while cruising.
That's the difference.

One is work.
The other is a by-product.

And by-products are the best products.

---

**The Interplay**

Solar brings power when the sun shines.
The alternator brings power when the engine runs.
Shore power brings power when you're at the right dock.

None of the three sources is enough alone.
All three together are always enough.

That's not a plan.
That's evolution.
You try what works and do more of it.

---

In summer:
Solar carries the main load.
Cruising tops up.
Shore power is a luxury you rarely need.

In autumn:
Solar weakens.
Cruising becomes more important.
Shore power more often welcome.

In winter:
Solar takes a break.
Cruising less frequent, because cold.
Shore power saves the day.
Every day.

---

**The Realisation**

You don't need a perfect plan.
You need options.

Option A doesn't work?
Option B.
Option B doesn't work either?
Option C.

Something always works.
And if nothing works, you turn off the fridge and wait for better weather.

The beer won't get warm.
Not in November anyway.

---

The nice thing about a boat is: you move.
And whoever moves, charges.

You don't cruise to charge.
But you charge because you cruise.

That's not strategy.
That's luck that looks like planning.

And sometimes luck is all you need.

---

**What Remains**

Three sources, one goal: battery full.

Shore power for convenience.
Alternator for on the move.
Solar for the good days.

You learn to use all three.
Not because you have to.
But because it's easier than relying on just one.

And if the sun doesn't shine for a week?
Then you cruise.
Or plug in.
Or both.

No drama.
Just everyday life.

With a full battery at the end.
Mostly.
