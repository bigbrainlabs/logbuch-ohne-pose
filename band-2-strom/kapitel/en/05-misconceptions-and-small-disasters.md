# Volume 2 – Chapter 5: Misconceptions & Small Disasters

The battery is big.
The solar system is there.
Everything thought through.
You even made Excel spreadsheets.

Still: surprises.
Physics didn't read the spreadsheets.

**Misconception 1: Big Battery = Self-Sufficiency**

280 Ah.
That sounds like reserves.
That sounds like "I've planned ahead".

It is.
For three to four days.

Not for a week.
Not for bad weather.
Not when you forget that the fridge wants power at night too. The audacity of this technology.

The battery isn't a storage tank.
It's a buffer between "now" and "charging again soon".
A very patient buffer, but not a miracle.

**Misconception 2: Solar Covers Consumption**

In summer: yes.
The rest of the year: sometimes.
In January: theoretically.

260 Wp can bring 1,200 Wh.
Or 300.
Or almost nothing.
Or, on particularly grey days, so little that you wonder if the panels even work anymore or are just staying on the roof out of politeness.

Solar isn't a power contract.
Solar is weather with extra steps.

---

**Misconception 3: Small Things Don't Matter**

Light. Radio. The small consumer that supposedly only draws 2 amps.
Together: 600 Wh per day.

That's half the consumption.

You don't see it.
You don't hear it.
You only notice when the battery is suddenly emptier than the promise "I'll be right back".

**The First Small Disaster**

Three cloudy days.
Fridge ran through, because warm beer is not an option.
Evening light, a bit of TV. Just two episodes. Or three. Maybe four.

On the fourth morning: 12.1 V.
BMS close to shutdown.
Display blinking accusingly.

No panic.
Just the feeling: That went faster than expected.
And the quiet suspicion that maybe you shouldn't have watched that extra episode last night.

Shore power connected.
Two hours later everything fine again.
Battery forgives.
Self-reproach lingers another day.

No disaster.
Just a reality check with a learning effect.

---

**Misconception 4: You'll Notice When the Battery Gets Low**

You don't.

Light works.
Fridge runs.
Everything normal.
The world pretends everything is fine.

Until the display suddenly shows 12.0 V and you think: For how long? And why didn't anyone warn me?

LiFePO₄ holds voltage stable for a long time.
Then it tips.
No warning, no dramatic music, just: *click*.

You learn to look at the display.
Not just when something doesn't work.
But preventively.
Like checking fuel, only with more self-reproach.

---

**What Remains**

The battery isn't too small.
The solar isn't too weak.
The plan wasn't bad.

Just the assumptions were optimistic.
And the brochures too.

That's not defeat.
That's learning through power outage.

You adapt.
Turn more off at night.
Cruise more often.
Use shore power earlier.
Develop a feel for when "12.4 V" means "all good" and when it means "better get to bed early tonight".

And it works.
Just differently than expected.
But hey, at least with beer.
