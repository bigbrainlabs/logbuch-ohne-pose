# Volume 2 – Chapter 2: The Consumer Inventory

You think you know where the power goes.
You're wrong.

---

The fridge is the main suspect.
Always.
On every boat, every camper van, every conversation about power.

"The fridge draws too much."
Everyone says that.
It's true, too.

300 Wh per day.
That's a third of total consumption.
For cold beer.

You could start thinking about priorities now.
You don't.
Beer is beer.

---

But at least the fridge is honest.
It runs, it draws, you know it.
No surprises.

The others are worse.
They sneak up on you.

---

**The Lights**

LED, energy-saving, barely any consumption.
Says so on the packaging.
True enough, per lamp.

But who only has one lamp on?

Salon: two spots.
Galley: one strip.
Sleeping cabin: reading lamp.
Cockpit: mood lighting, because it's cosy.

Together: 25 watts.
Sounds like nothing.

Five hours in the evening: 125 Wh.
That's not nothing.
That's an eighth of daily consumption.

For light.
That you half forget to turn off.

---

**The Radio**

Running.
Always.
In the background.

You don't even listen anymore.
It plays away while you do something else.
Company for the fridge.

8 watts.
Ridiculous.

12 hours a day: 96 Wh.
Not quite so ridiculous anymore.

You turn off the radio when you're not listening.
Revolutionary idea.
Could have thought of that earlier.

---

**The TV**

One episode in the evening.
Or two.
Or the whole season, because cliffhanger.

60 watts.
Three hours: 180 Wh.

That's almost as much as the fridge.
For three hours of entertainment.

You look at the battery.
You look at the series.
You choose the series.

Regret it the next morning.
Sometimes.

---

**The Computer**

You have to work too.
Or at least pretend to.

Laptop: 45 watts.
Four hours: 180 Wh.

Plus the tablet for casual scrolling.
And the phone that's constantly plugged in.
And the second phone, because you have two.

Another 50 Wh combined.
Per day.
Without noticing.

---

**The Instruments**

You forget those.

Instruments at the helm.
Always running.
Even when no one's looking.

Chartplotter, depth sounder, the little screen showing voltage.
Irony: The device showing power consumption itself consumes power.

Not much.
But it adds up.
Like everything.

---

**The Phantom Load**

And then there's the power that always flows.
Whether you're there or not.
Whether you switch anything on or not.

1.5 to 2 amps.
Around the clock.
That's 36 to 48 Wh.
Per day.

For what?

Good question.

Something always draws.
Standby here, LED indicator there, the clock on the stove.
The smoke detector.
The charger that's not charging anything but still wants power.
The BMS, watching over the battery so it doesn't die, while slowly draining it itself.

You could switch all that off.
You don't.
Because then you'd have to reset the clock every time.

So: 48 Wh per day for the luxury of not having to set the clock.

Sounds absurd.
It is.

---

**The Calculation**

Fridge: 300 Wh (during the day)
Lights: 125 Wh
Radio: 96 Wh (when you forget to turn it off)
TV: 180 Wh (a season has many episodes)
Computer + devices: 230 Wh
Instruments: 50 Wh
Phantom load: 48 Wh

Total: around 1,000 Wh.

Every day.

With 280 Ah LiFePO₄, that's about 3.5 days.
If the sun doesn't shine.
If you don't cruise.
If you don't change anything.

Three and a half days.
Then it's over.

Not over with drama.
Over with TV.

---

**The Realisation**

You can optimise the big consumers.
Fridge off at night: saves 100 Wh.
Less TV: saves 100 Wh.
Radio only when listening: saves 50 Wh.

But the small things remain.
They add up.
They're the reason the battery empties faster than expected.

You're not fighting the fridge.
You're fighting a hundred small decisions every day.

Light on or off?
Radio on or off?
One more episode or bed?

Every decision: a few watt-hours.
Every day: a thousand watt-hours.

---

**The Trick**

Not consuming less.
Consuming more consciously.

Light on when you need it.
Off when you don't.

Radio on when you're listening.
Off when you're not.

TV on when you're actually watching.
Not just because it's there.

You don't become an ascetic.
You become an accountant.
Just with watt-hours instead of euros.

---

In winter it's easier.
Less time aboard, less consumption.

Only the phantom load remains.
The 1.5 to 2 amps that always flow.
The baseline load of existence.

You get used to it.
To the numbers, to the calculating, to the constant awareness.

And at some point it's normal.
You don't think about it anymore.
You just do it.

Light off when you leave.
Radio off when you're not listening.
Fridge off at night, so the beer is still cold enough in the morning.

No big deal.
Just a different way of handling what you have.

And the beer?
The beer is always cold.

Priorities.
