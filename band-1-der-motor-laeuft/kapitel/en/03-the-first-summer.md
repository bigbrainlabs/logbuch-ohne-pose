# Volume 1 – Chapter 3: The First Summer

*It works (sort of)*

---

May.

The boat sits at the dock.

Freshly painted, clean, ready.

Me too.

Theoretically.

---

First trip out.

Alone.

No seller.
No previous owner.
Just me.

And the boat.

Exciting.

Bit scary.

But: exciting.

---

Checklist in my head:

1. Start engine
2. Cast off
3. Don't crash into other boats
4. Come back

Sounds simple.

It is.

Always.

---

Key in.

Turn.

Starter whines.

Engine coughs.

Once.

Twice.

Hum.

The engine runs.

First hurdle: cleared.

---

Voltmeter: 12.0V

Of course.

Fuel gauge: 3/4

Obviously.

Depth gauge: 2.3m

That's the only instrument I trust.

---

Cast off.

Slowly reverse.

Boat responds more sluggishly than expected.

But: responds.

Turn.

Forward.

Throttle up.

Engine hums louder.

Boat moves.

I'm driving a boat.

First time.

Alone.

Brilliant.

---

Out of the harbour.

Slowly.

5 knots.

Not because I have to.

But because I'm still cautious.

Other boats watching.

"Beginner," they're probably thinking.

True enough.

---

Open water.

Throttle up.

Engine pulls.

Boat accelerates.

Not spectacular.

Not fast.

But: moves.

I look at the dashboard.

RPM: Somewhere between 2,000 and 2,400.
Don't know exactly.
The needle is... creative.

Voltmeter: 12.0V

Still.

While driving too.

Interesting.

---

Fuel gauge: 3/4

After 30 minutes of driving.

Still 3/4.

Either the tank is massive.

Or the gauge is lying.

Probably the latter.

---

One hour later: back.

Docking.

Not perfect.

But no damage.

Good enough.

Engine off.

Voltmeter: 12.0V

Surprise.

---

I sit in the cockpit.

Beer open.

Grinning like an idiot.

First trip.

Alone.

Works.

Everything works.

Engine runs.
Boat drives.
I'm still alive.

Success.

---

June.

Routine sets in.

Every weekend out.

Sometimes alone.
Sometimes with friends.

Boat works.

Always.

Reliably.

Except for...

---

The heater.

Sometimes it runs.
Sometimes it doesn't.

No rule.
No logic.

Switch on: runs.
Next day, switch on: doesn't run.

Loose connection.

Probably.

---

I wiggle the switch.

Left.
Right.
In.
Out.

Heater: on.

Ah.

I learn: It's a feel switch.

You have to hold it JUST SO.

Not too firm.
Not too loose.

Just right.

Then it works.

---

Friend asks: "Why don't you fix it?"

"It works."

"But you have to wiggle."

"Yes. But then it works."

He shakes his head.

Me too.

But: heater runs.

Good enough.

---

July.

Hot.

Nobody needs a heater.

Problem solved.

Temporarily.

---

I go out.

Regularly.

Getting to know the boat.

How it responds.
How it feels.
What it likes.
What it doesn't.

Boat and I are becoming friends.

Slowly.

But surely.

---

Voltmeter shows 12.0V.

Always.

I get used to it.

It is what it is.

Engine running? → Good.
Engine off? → Also good.

As long as the thing turns over, everything's fine.

Probably.

Hopefully.

Most likely.

---

Fuel gauge shows 3/4.

Getting used to that too.

I drive by feel.

How long have I been out?
How much could be left?
Should I fill up?

Gut feeling.

Works.

So far.

---

August.

Longest trip yet: 6 hours.

There and back.

Engine runs the whole time.

No sputtering.
No overheating.
No drama.

Just: runs.

Built 1985, but runs like new.

Whatever the previous owner did — engine-wise he knew his stuff.

---

Fuel gauge at the end of the trip: 3/4.

Of course.

I fill up anyway.

To be safe.

It takes 120 litres.

Tank holds 200.

So: had 80 litres left.

Fuel gauge says: 3/4.

Mathematically that would be 150 litres.

Difference: 70 litres.

The gauge isn't just inaccurate.

It's creative.

---

Voltmeter after 6 hours of driving: 12.0V.

I laugh.

What else?

The thing isn't broken.

It's... optimistic.

Always shows "all good."

Whether it's true or not.

---

Evening at the dock.

Neighbour comes by.

"Nice boat."

"Thanks."

"Runs well?"

"Yes. Engine's great."

"And the rest?"

I hesitate.

"Works. Mostly. Somehow."

He laughs.

"Welcome to the boat owner club."

---

September.

First signs that I want more.

Not more boat.

More... knowledge.

---

I sit in the cockpit.

Looking at the voltmeter.

12.0V.

But WHAT does that mean?

Is the battery at 100%?
80%?
50%?

No idea.

Engine runs, so: good.

But I WANT to know.

---

Fuel gauge.

3/4.

Always 3/4.

How much is REALLY in there?

150 litres?
120?
80?

I could calculate.

Filled up: 200 litres full.
Driven: 3 hours.
Consumption: ~10 litres/hour.
Therefore: 170 litres left.

Or?

---

But that's guessing.

Estimating.

Hoping.

I don't want estimates.

I want data.

Numbers.

Facts.

---

I Google.

"Digital fuel gauge boat"

Results:
- Product 1: €450
- Product 2: €380
- Product 3: "On request"

Expensive.

---

"Digital voltmeter boat"

Results:
- Product 1: €120
- Product 2: €95
- Product 3: €89

Not cheap either.

For a display that shows a number.

---

I scroll further.

"DIY boat voltmeter"

Ah.

Interesting.

Forum post: "Self-build with Arduino for €15"

I click.

---

30 minutes later: 10 tabs open.

Arduino.
ESP32.
Voltage divider.
Resistors.
ADC.

Concepts I know from the workbench.

And: interesting for the boat.

---

I look at the voltmeter.

12.0V.

Then at the laptop.

"ESP32 voltmeter tutorial"

Video: 15 minutes.

I watch.

Understand most of it.

And that's enough.

To get curious.

---

Evening.

Beer open.

Boat sits quietly at the dock.

I think.

"Could I...?"

---

Voltmeter: €15 in parts.
Fuel gauge: €20 in parts.

Instead of €450 and €120.

And: I learn something.

And: I understand what's happening.

And: it's MINE.

---

The thought stays.

Sticks.

Grows.

"I could..."

---

October.

Cooler.

Boat gets used less.

More time to think.

And watch YouTube.

Dangerous.

---

I watch videos.

"Arduino for beginners"
"ESP32 tutorial"
"Boat electrics explained"

Hour after hour.

Tab after tab.

---

I take stock of the parts box.

All there.

Of course.

- LED strips (need to order, €12)
- Resistors (€3)
- ESP32 (€8)

"Finally a project again."

Famous last words.

---

November.

Boat in hibernation.

Shore power connected.

Heater runs (if you wiggle).

Time for projects.

---

I sit at home.

Laptop open.

Notepad beside me.

Sketch:

```
Voltmeter (digital):
ESP32 → Voltage divider → Battery
        → Display shows real voltage

Cost: ~€20
Effort: ???
```

Looks doable.

Theoretically.

---

I order.

ESP32.
Resistors.
Cables.
Nudge the ESP32 with my nose.

Ordered: LED strips. €12. Rest I've already got.

"I'll start small."

LED lighting.

Then voltmeter.

Then... we'll see.

---

Package arrives.

I unpack.

ESP32.

Small.

Unassuming.

Doesn't look like much.

---

I hold it up.

"This is going to digitise my boat?"

Said out loud.

Sounds ridiculous.

But YouTube says: Yes.

---

I put the ESP32 on the table.

Next to it: boat photos.

Dashboard.
Voltmeter (12.0V).
Fuel gauge (3/4).

And think:

"This can be better."

---

The first summer was good.

Boat works.
Engine runs.
Everything floats.

But:

Voltmeter lies.
Fuel gauge fantasises.
Heater needs finesse.

I don't want estimates.

I want data.

Real data.

---

The plan:

Phase 1: LED lighting (can't be THAT hard)
Phase 2: Digital voltmeter (€15 instead of €120)
Phase 3: ... we'll see

Start small.

Scale up slowly.

Don't overdo it.

---

3 years later:

8 ESP32s installed.
47 sensors.
Custom operating system.
Dashboard for everything.

"Start small" I'd said.

Ha.

No.

---

But that came later.

Much later.

First I had to learn that LED + 12V direct = smoke.

Trial & error.

Lots of error.

Little trial.

But: it came together.

---

The first summer was the beginning.

From user to tinkerer.

From accepter to improver.

From "it works" to "it can be better."

---

December.

Boat sits still.

Cold.

Dark.

Engine off.

But:

At home, at the desk, the light is on.

ESP32 on the table.

Laptop beside it.

Tutorial on the screen.

"Install Arduino IDE"

I click.

Download.

The first step.

---

The boat doesn't know it yet.

But next summer will be different.

Digital.

Measurable.

Data-driven.

---

The engine?

Just keeps running.

As always.

Doesn't care about ESP32s.

Doesn't care about plans.

Runs.

---

And me?

I'm learning to code.

In December.

For a boat.

That actually works fine.

But could be better.

Because I want it to be.

Not because it has to be.

---

The first summer was good.

The second will be better.

I think.

I hope.

I'll try.
