# Volume 1 – Chapter 1: The Purchase

*Or: "Actually quite decent"*

---

The listing had been online for three weeks.

"Motorboat, built 1985, freshly painted, technically flawless, berth optional."

That last word was important.
Boats without a berth are like cars without a parking spot.
Possible, but annoying.

The price was fair.
Not cheap.
Not overpriced.
Right in the middle between "bargain" and "something's off."

I called.

---

The seller sounded relaxed.
No pressure.
No excuses.
Just: "Come by, have a look."

That was a good sign.

Sellers who pressure you are selling problems.
Sellers who are relaxed are selling boats.

The difference is subtle, but important.

---

Saturday, 10 AM, dock 7.

The boat was there.
Calm.
Not particularly big.
Not particularly small.
Just: there.

Hull freshly painted, white, clean.
Below the waterline: flawless.
Above: "We'll do that later."

The deck had patina.
Not bad.
Just old.

Superstructure too.
Paint peeling in two spots.
"Cosmetic," I thought.

---

The seller arrived.
Mid-50s, jeans, polo shirt, boat shoes.
Looked like someone who knows boats.

"Glad you could make it. Want to come aboard?"

I nodded.

We climbed in.

---

Inside it was... okay.

Not modern.
Not fancy.
But clean.

Cushions had stains.
"Normal wear and tear," he said.
True.

Curtains were yellow.
From the sun.
Or from age.
Probably both.

Floor was linoleum.
Practical.
Ugly, but practical.

"Want to hear the engine?"

Of course I did.

---

He turned the key.

Starter whined.
Engine coughed.
Once.
Twice.

Then: a hum.

No sputtering.
No smoke.
No drama.

Just: on.

"Runs well, doesn't it?"

I nodded.

The engine ran.
Quiet, steady, no complaints.

Built in 1985, but sounded like new.

"Maintenance?"

"Oil every year. Filter too. That's all it needs."

I believed him.

---

We talked details.

Berth: can be taken over, doesn't have to be.
Papers: all there.
Inspection: valid for two more years.
Insurance: active.

"Why are you selling?"

"Not enough time. Boat sits more than it sails."

Honest answer.

No "have to sell because of a move" or "health reasons."
Just: no time.

Happens.

---

I looked around again.

Dashboard:
- Voltmeter (digital, shows 12.0V)
- Tachometer (analog, year of manufacture unknown)
- Depth gauge (digital, more recent)
- Fuel gauge (analog, shows 3/4)

Everything worked.

"Instruments running?"

"Everything. Except the GPS sometimes."

"Sometimes?"

"Takes its time. Then it works."

Okay.

---

The electrics.

I opened the hatch under the seat.

Fuse box.
Small, tidy.
10 fuses, labelled.

Well.

Almost labelled.

"Light," "Pump," "Engine," "Miscellaneous."

Miscellaneous.

Interesting word.

"What's Miscellaneous?"

He shrugged.
"GPS, I think. Or the outlet. One of the two."

I laughed.

He did too.

"It was like that when I bought it."

That sentence would come back to haunt me.

---

Cables.

Black, red, yellow, white, blue.

"Why so many colours?"

"Previous owners. Each had their own style."

Made sense.
Weird sense, but sense.

"But everything works?"

"Everything."

Good enough.

---

We went for a spin.

Engine ran.
Boat moved.
Straight, no pulling.
Rudder responded.
All good.

Back at the dock, I asked the question:

"What's the catch?"

He laughed.

"Deck needs doing. Superstructure too, if you want it looking nice. Inside is all old, but works."

Honest.

"Anything else?"

"Engine runs. Boat floats. Rest is cosmetic."

Sounded fair.

---

We agreed on the price.

No negotiation.
He wanted X.
I paid X.

Deal.

---

A week later I signed.

The boat was mine.

I stood on the dock, looked at it, and thought:

"This is going to be good."

---

That was in April.

In May I painted the deck.
In June the superstructure.
In July I went out alone for the first time.

Everything ran.

The engine anyway.

But the rest too.

Voltmeter showed 12.0V.
Fuel gauge showed 3/4.
GPS took its time, then worked.

Everything as described.

Everything worked.

And yet...

---

Something bugged me.

Not much.
Not dramatic.

But something was off.

Voltmeter showed 12.0V.
Always.
Whether the engine was running.
Whether shore power was connected.
Just: 12.0V.

Fuel gauge showed 3/4.
Even after 4 hours of driving.
Even after a week of sitting.
Always: 3/4.

GPS took 10 minutes.
Sometimes 15.
Once 30.

Why?

No idea.

---

In August someone at the dock asked:

"How much diesel do you have left?"

I looked at the fuel gauge.

3/4.

"About 150 litres?"

"About?"

"The gauge is... open to interpretation."

He laughed.

"Welcome to the club."

---

In September I filled up.

Full.

Tank holds 200 litres.

It took 180 litres.

The fuel gauge showed: 3/4.

Before: 3/4.
After: 3/4.

Right.

---

In October I connected the shore power.

Charge the battery.

Voltmeter: 12.0V.

After 12 hours: 12.0V.

After 24 hours: 12.0V.

Is the battery full now?

No idea.

Feels full.

Engine starts fine.

So: good?

---

In November I sat in the boat.

Heater on.

Ran.

One hour later: off.

Loose connection?

I wiggled the switch.

Heater: on.

Right.

---

In December I asked myself:

"Why do I actually know NOTHING about my boat?"

Voltmeter shows 12.0V.
But what does that mean?
Is the battery at 80%? 50%? 20%?

Fuel gauge shows 3/4.
But is that 150 litres? 120? 80?

Engine runs.
But how warm is it?
How much oil pressure?
How many hours on it?

I didn't know.

And that bugged me.

---

Not because the boat was bad.

The boat was good.

Better than most at the dock.

The engine ran.
The thing floated.
Everything worked.

But I didn't know WHAT was happening.

I GUESSED.
I ASSUMED.
I ESTIMATED.

But I didn't KNOW.

---

One evening in December I sat at home.

Laptop open.

YouTube.

"Boat electrics explained"

3 hours later I had 50 tabs open.

Voltmeters.
Shunts.
Battery monitoring.
ESP32.
Arduino.
Sensors.

The idea was born.

Slowly.

Creeping.

Dangerously.

---

"I could... digitise this."

The thought was there.

Small.
Innocent.
Naive.

"Just a little. LED lighting. Maybe a digital voltmeter."

Famous last words.

---

3 years later:

8 ESP32s installed.
Custom operating system.
Dashboard for everything.
Live data.
Navigation.
Controls.

All digital.
All networked.
All smart.

The engine?

Still running.

Unchanged.

Like day one.

---

But that came later.

Much later.

First I bought LEDs.

"I'll start small," I thought.

Spoiler: I didn't.
